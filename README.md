# My Desktop Shell

This is my bar & other assorted widgets that I use on my Linux desktop.
Not particularly customizable.

Required things:
- AGS v2
- Hyprland
- IBM Plex Sans & Font Awesome 6
- GNOME System Monitor (soon)
- nm-connection-editor
- pavucontrol

## TODO
- Synthetic SyncThing tray icon
- Notifications
- Make notification center actually usable
- app launcher?
